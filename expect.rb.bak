  # be used to send and receive data on any read/write IO object.

    # if the last call to expect resulted in a timeout, then before is an empty string
    attr_reader :before

    # Create a new Expect object for the given IO object
    #
    # There are two ways to create a new Expect object.  The first is to supply
    # a single IO object with a read/write mode.  The second method is to supply
    # a read file handle as the first argument and a write file handle as the
    # second argument.
    #
    # +args+::
    #   at most 3 arguments, 1 or 2 IO objects (read/write or read + write and
    #   an optional options hash.  The only currently supported option is :debug
    #   (default false) which, if enabled, will send data received on the input
    #   filehandle to STDOUT
